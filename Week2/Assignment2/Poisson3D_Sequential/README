The Poisson problem in 3D
-------------------------

The files provided here are meant as a starting point for your second
assignment in the DTU course 02614.  

Makefile           - the project Makefile
poisson3d.f90      - template for main program
poisson_method.f90 - a placeholder for all Poisson methods
precision.f90      - the parameters for the different precisions

In poisson3d.f90, you can find a suggestion for a reasonable program structure,
and it allows dumping data to the disk.
You will need to write code for the iterators, the data
initialization, etc.
You can put the initialization where you wish; in poisson_methods.f90, in
poisson3d.f90 or in a separate module, you decide.

Running the executable requires the use of a namelist contained in a file
called input.dat.
The file currently contains all variables, but leaving one out just uses
the default value.


How to use ParaView
-------------------
1) To open ParaView under ThinLinc, do the following: 

In the Applications menu at the top, go to 
    DTU -> xterm (VirtualGL-application node) 
which is the last entry in this menu.

A new terminal will open - read the message, and press ENTER to start
the shell session.  To start ParaView, type the command
    vglrun paraview58
This will start ParaView version 5.8 with accelerated graphics
support.

In ParaView, you can open the .vtk file created by your program: click
on the file open icon, go to the folder with your files, and open the
.vtk file generated by your program.

After you have opened the file, you need to click on the green 'Apply'
button (to the left), and then you can choose a visualization
(Outline), e.g.  'Slice' or 'Volume'.
